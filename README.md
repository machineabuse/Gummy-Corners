# Gummy-Corners
3D printable corner spaces to make sure your gummy worm corners don't touch!

## Description
As it so happens, Gummy worm mount keyboards like the Bakaneko often have issues with the front corners making contact with the case during the downstroke in some instances. This is due to the uneven stagger of the keys at the corners of the board. These 3D printes spacers are placed over the corners beneath the big O-Ring and give it the correct spacing.

Big thanks to ZZCC for being a willing volunteer to see if this design works (As well as for the photographs). His findings were that these will mute the corner switches slightly however they will achieve the stated goal of ensuring the corners are properly spaced to the case.

## How to use these

You will need to print these as a pair, they simply slip on over the front of the corner switches. They are designed with a long and a short side so they can simply be inverted if you have an ANSI/Tsangan layout. For arrow key/65% layouts you will only need one for the left corner of your board as a 1U corner should already be correctly spaced.
